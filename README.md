# Spam Email Classification

This is a simple project in which I attempt making a classifier for spam text. It uses Bag-of-Words text mining model. 

For classifying the text document into either the spam category or not spam category, I used Multinommial Naive Bayes classifier. I used this classifier in particular because it is one of the simplest and most efficient logistic regression model out there. It is super fast and performs real good.
